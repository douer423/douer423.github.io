## 1.Introduction
Version control has become an indispensable tool in modern software development. Version control systems allow you to keep track of your software at the source level. You can track changes, revert to previous stages, and branch off from the base code to create alternative versions of files and directories.

One of the most popular version control systems is [git](https://git-scm.com/). Many projects maintain their files in a Git repository, and sites like GitHub and Bitbucket have made sharing and contributing to code with Git easier than ever.

In this guide, we will demonstrate how to install Git on a CentOS 7 server. We will cover how to install the software in a couple of different ways, each with their own benefits, along with how to set up Git so that you can begin collaborating right away.

## 2.Prerequisites
Before you begin with this guide, there are a few steps that need to be completed first.

You will need a CentOS 7 server installed. If you haven't done this yet, you can run through steps 1-4 in the CentOS 7 initial server setup guide to create this account.
